# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Emma!

I'm a **Software Developer Trainee** who began my coding journey mid 2025, starting with Python.

## ðŸ’» What I'm Learning

- **Python:** My starting point into the world of programming!
- **Problem Solving:** I love tackling new coding challenges every day.
- **Expanding Horizons:** Over the next two years of my training, I plan to learn:
  - **C++**
  - **HTML**
  - **JavaScript**
  - ...and many more!

## ðŸš€ Projects

### ASCII-Imagegenerator
I created an **ASCII-Imagegenerator**â€”a fun project that turns images into ASCII art using Python. It taught me a lot about working with tkinter and creative coding.

### Calculator
Another project I built is a small **Calculator**, with the help of GitHub Copilot. Itâ€™s a simple tool, but it helped me understand how to structure code, solve practical problems, and introduced me to **Object-Oriented Programming** and **modular systems**.

## ðŸ“š About Me

- **Problem solver:** I enjoy the part of coding and figuring out how I can solve a problem.
- **Curious learner:** I love exploring how things work and turning ideas into code.
- **Growth mindset:** Always looking for new skills and ways to improve.
- **Currently in training:** My training as a Software Developer will continue for about 2 years.

## ðŸŒ± Whatâ€™s Next?

Iâ€™m excited to explore new Python projects and expand into areas like web development, automation, and data science. Each step brings me closer to becoming a versatile developer!
